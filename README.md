## Hi I made this website becuase I needed something to organize my time and I though about it and noticed that it was same for other students. So I made something simple so its easy to use and anyone can use it easily. If you are reading this and need something to organize your time I recomend you to use this I have a discord server and here's the link https://discord.gg/6ZJhGFMJt. Fun fact is that update the stustudy every sundays and saturdays so use it to organize your time.
